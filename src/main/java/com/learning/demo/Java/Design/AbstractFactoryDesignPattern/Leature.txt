Game
    Different Level
        each level consists set of enemies, weapons and power-ups.
You can use of Abstract Factory that create these objects amd
then create a concrete implementations.

This allows you to switch between levels easily
without having to worry about the specific implementations
details of each objects.

Factory Pattern is used to create a single type of object
Abstract Factory is used to create families of related and

Examples
Scenario:
You are designing a UI toolkit that should
work on two operating systems:

Windows, Mac

Each OS has its own style of:ÃŸÃŸÃŸÃŸ
Button
Checkbox

ðŸ‘‰ Implement an Abstract Factory Pattern so that:

WindowsFactory creates WindowsButton + WindowsCheckbox

MacFactory creates MacButton + MacCheckbox

This ensures that the UI components always match the OS style.
