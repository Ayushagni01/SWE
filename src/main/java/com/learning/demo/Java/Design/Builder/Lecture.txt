Builder Design Pattern
----------------------
Creational Design Pattern
    It is used to create a complex object.
    If there is large no. of attribute in
    a class and you want to create an object.

Person
      FistName, LastName, Age, Gender, Phone.



      Suppose we are creating an immutable object
      of the person of the class which means, we will not change the
      object of the state after object creation.

      Now,

      Suppose we have FirstName and LastName are mandatory
      and all other field are not mandatory.

      Suppose created a set of constructor.

      Now in future, if we will add more attribute in the class
      then we have to add more constructor.

      This approach is not good for long term project.

      Builder Design Pattern is the solution of this problem.

        Steps to Create a Builder Design Pattern
            1. Create a static nested inner class  = Builder class
            2. The builder class copies all the properties from the outer class to the builder class.
                Person -> PersonBuilder
            3. Buidler class contains
                1. Public constructor with only required attribute.
                2. will contains some setter for optional attributes and it will return the same builder object.
                3. Have Build Method , return the object needed by the client programs.
                4. we need to have a private constructor in the Class with Builder class as an argument.

Advantage of Builder Pattern

Flexible and code is more maintainable.
maintains the immutability of the object.


Disadvantage
Increase the number of line of code.
We have to create a BuilderClass for each different type of Product.
